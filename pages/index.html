        <h1 class="mt-5">10 MOST USEFUL HTML TAGS</h1>
        <section class="mt-5">
            <h3>1. &lt;HEAD> &lt;/HEAD></h3>
            <p>The head part of an HTML document. Moreover, this is where you have metadata, which is data about the
                styling of the document, what kind of JavaScript libraries the document uses, title and CSS files.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>2. &lt;DIV> &lt;/DIV></h3>
            <p>An element which is mostly used to group elements and to act as a template for new controls. The div HTML
                tag is an element you will use to divide a significant part of an HTML document from other parts. For
                examplle, let’s say you have a list of products on your web page, you will use a div for each product.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. &lt;H1> &lt;/H1> </h3>
            <p>Headings (levels 1-6, i.e. H3 is a subheading within a H2 subheading). H1, H2,... tags are used to create
                titles. Why do we need titles, when we can style a text to look like H tags? For instance, titles are
                used so that search engines and other scrapers (bots) understand the important parts of our documents.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4. &lt;I> &lt;/I></h3>
            <p>If you have a lot of text, then you need to emphasise some words to let the reader know what is
                important. Rather, with italics you can present text that is a little tilted to the right.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>4. &lt;IMG></h3>
            <p>We use the IMG tag to show images. Considering that images can be within files for your web page or
                anywhere online. In addition, the most important attribute is src (source), which tells where the
                picture is.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>5. &lt;LI> &lt;/LI></h3>
            <p>List item. A tag that is used within an ordered (&lt;OL>) or unordered (&lt;UL>) list. Not to mention,
                you can have as many as you like.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>6. &lt;OL> &lt;/OL></h3>
            <p>Ordered list. Also includes &lt;LI> List Items, which will be numbered automatically. As a consequence,
                this is very useful if you add more list items, because the numbers will always be in the right order.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>7. &lt;P> &lt;/P></h3>
            <p>The paragraph tag groups text into a paragraph :D (That is funny). Hence its purpose is to separate a
                part of text or paragraph, this way you make it more readable and organized..</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>8. &lt;STRONG> &lt;/STRONG></h3>
            <p>Text is emphasised strongly - usually appears in bold, most of the time it looks like bold too. But it
                has an additional meaning, that this text should be emphasised.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>9. &lt;UL> &lt;/UL>
            </h3>
            <p>An unordered list just means that it will have bullets for each item in the list. List items will have
                bullets for each item.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>10. &lt;A> &lt;/A>
            </h3>
            <p>In short, this is a tag that helps you make a link to a web page, to your page, social media site,
                product within online store,... The main attribute for this HTML tag is the href (Hypertext Reference)
                attribute, where you put a link to a website you want to link to. The other attribute is target, it can
                be used to open a link in a new window, so that users don’t lose focus on the current page. </p>
